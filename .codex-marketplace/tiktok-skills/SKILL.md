description: Plan, script, caption, and publish short-form video for TikTok. Use when the user wants to write the first 1-3 second hook (spoken line plus on-screen text), draft a caption under 2,200 chars with TikTok settings and hashtags, ride a trending sound without being cringe, strip AI tells from a spoken script to sound human on camera, or plan a week around completion rate. TikTok is video-only: the user supplies the video, the skills produce the script, caption, and settings, then publish via Publora.

# TikTok Marketing Skills

A bundle of 8 focused skills for TikTok content ops in 2026. Each skill is
single-purpose, follows the draft then approval then publish pattern, and uses
the [Publora API](https://publora.com) for scheduling the rendered video.

## When to use this bundle

- **Scripting the first 1-3 second hook** (spoken line, on-screen text, visual) -> use `tt-hook-scripter`
- **Writing the caption, TikTok settings, and hashtags** -> use `tt-caption-writer`
- **Riding a trending sound or format for your niche** -> use `tt-trend-mapper`
- **Stripping AI tells from a spoken script, or auditing it before filming** -> use `tt-humanizer` (rewrite plus `--mode audit` pre-publish review, which folds in the post-audit sub-tool)
- **Planning a week of posting around completion rate** -> use `tt-content-planner`
- **Adapting content from another platform into a TikTok script and caption** -> use `tt-repurposer`
- **Auditing or rewriting the profile (photo, name, bio, pinned videos, link)** -> use `tt-profile-optimizer`

## TikTok is video-only

TikTok does not accept text-only or image-only posts. Every post is a video. This
bundle does not generate video. It produces the spoken hook script, the on-screen
text, the caption, the hashtags, and the recommended posting settings. **The user
supplies the rendered .mp4.** Publishing then follows the media flow below.

- **Reading your TikTok niche and audience from real data** -> use `tt-audience-insights`

## Core pattern

Every action-taking skill follows three steps:

1. **Parse the input.** If the user gives a TikTok video or profile URL, the
   skill uses `lib/url_parser.py` to extract the handle and video id.
2. **Draft the content.** The skill applies 2026 research (TikTok hook formulas,
   sound timing, voice rules, ranking heuristics) and shows the draft to the user.
3. **Wait for approval.** The user replies "post", "yes", or suggests edits.
   Only after explicit approval, and only when a rendered video file exists, does
   the skill call Publora to publish.

## The publish flow (video-only)

Because TikTok requires media, a post cannot go out as plain text. The flow is:

```
1. POST /create-post              -> caption draft, no scheduledTime
2. POST /get-upload-url           -> pre-signed S3 URL for the .mp4
3. PUT  {uploadUrl}               -> upload the rendered video
4. PUT  /update-post/:postGroupId -> set scheduledTime to schedule it
```

`lib.publish("video", caption, target_url, video_path=..., scheduled_time=...)`
runs all four steps. Without a `video_path`, it returns the caption and settings
as a copy-paste block to upload in the TikTok app, plus an optional caption draft
in Publora to attach the video to later.

## Prerequisites

**Three tiers - pick one.**

### Tier 0 - Draft only (default, no setup)

The skills work out of the box. No API keys, no signup. Every approved draft is
returned as the script, the caption, and the settings to upload in the TikTok
app yourself. Great for trying the skills before committing to any backend.

### Tier 1 - Publora video scheduling (recommended, ~2 min once connected)

When you have a rendered .mp4, the skills run the draft -> upload -> schedule flow
via the [Publora API](https://publora.com).

1. Sign up free: **https://app.publora.com/signup**
2. Connect your TikTok account in Publora (Channels then Add Channel)
3. Copy your API key from Publora's API panel
4. Drop into `.env`:
   ```
   PUBLORA_API_KEY=sk_...
   TIKTOK_PLATFORM_ID=tiktok-...
   ```
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Why Publora: the official TikTok Content Posting API needs an OAuth flow and app
review. Publora handles the connection and the multi-step video upload in one
helper call, so we did not have to reimplement it.

### Tier 2 - Build your own poster (advanced)

Prefer not to SaaS it? Ask Claude Code or Codex to build a custom poster on the
official TikTok Content Posting API. Set `TIKTOK_SKILLS_CUSTOM_POSTER=<your
command>` and the skills invoke it on approval. Publora is the 2-minute path.

### Note on posting reality

TikTok requires a video file to publish. The writer skills produce everything
around the video (script, caption, settings); you record and render the clip.
With Publora connected and the .mp4 in hand, scheduling is automatic. Without a
file, you get the caption and settings to upload in-app.

## Voice rules (baked into every skill)

1. No em dashes (`—`), en dashes, or double dashes in captions or on-screen text.
2. Write the spoken script the way a person talks: contractions, fragments, short
   lines. Read it out loud before trusting it.
3. Capitalize all personal, company, and product names. Lowercase a brand reads
   as careless.
4. Specific numbers beat adjectives. "3 takes" beats "a few takes".
5. One idea per video. The first 1-3 seconds carry everything.
6. Spoken hook and on-screen text differ; both must land the promise (muted-first
   viewing is common).
7. Caption <= 2,200 chars (API). 3 to 5 mixed-reach hashtags at the end.
8. Avoid AI vocabulary: `leverage`, `fundamentally`, `streamline`, `harness`,
   `delve`, `unlock`, `foster`. And no "hey guys" / "don't forget to subscribe".

## How TikTok URLs map

| URL shape | Parsed to |
|---|---|
| `https://www.tiktok.com/@HANDLE/video/ID` | handle + video_id, type `video` |
| `https://vm.tiktok.com/CODE/` | short_code, type `short` (open to resolve the id) |
| `https://www.tiktok.com/t/CODE/` | short_code, type `short` |
| `https://www.tiktok.com/@HANDLE` | handle, type `profile` |

`lib/url_parser.parse_tiktok_url(url)` returns `{handle, video_id, short_code,
url_type, canonical_url}`. Short share links redirect to the canonical URL; the
parser does not make network calls, so resolve them by opening the link.

## Known gotchas

- **Completion rate is the king signal.** A short video watched fully beats a long
  one watched halfway. Cut to the shortest length that delivers the idea.
- **The hook is the first 1-3 seconds of the video, not the caption.** A great
  caption cannot save a slow open.
- **Boolean inversion bug** in TikTok interaction settings: Publora may map
  `allowComments` / `allowDuet` / `allowStitch` to TikTok's `disable_*` flags, so
  they can land inverted. Test with a `SELF_ONLY` draft before trusting them.
- **Unaudited apps post PRIVATE only.** Until the publishing app passes TikTok's
  review, posts are forced to `SELF_ONLY` regardless of `viewerSetting`.
- **Clean export.** A competing video app's watermark is reported to suppress
  reach. Export without one.
